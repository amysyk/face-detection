# Face detection
I wanted to see how reliable real-time face detection with OpenCV based on a pre-trained Haar cascade model is.

## Key findings
* Face detection is straightforward to implement.
* Face detection, as I implemented it, requires minimal computational resources.
* Face detection reliably detected multiple faces from various angles and in various lighting conditions.
